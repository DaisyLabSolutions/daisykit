# Model references

Below are the resources for Daisykit deep learning models. At the current phase of Daisykit, we are focusing on model deployment and overall architecture. Therefore, source code and tutorial for training may be not available for now.

- 1. Person detection (person_detector) and Human pose (Ultralight-Nano-SimplePose): Pretrained from <https://github.com/dog-qiuqiu/Ultralight-SimplePose>.
- 2. Facial landmark: <https://github.com/polarisZhao/PFLD-pytorch>; <https://github.com/nilseuropa/pfld_ncnn/>.
- 3. Face detection (with wearing_mask output): <https://github.com/waittim/mask-detector> (training code included).
- 4. Background matting: <https://github.com/lizhengwei1992/Fast_Portrait_Segmentation>, <https://github.com/nihui/ncnn-webassembly-portrait-segmentation>.
- 5. Human pose estimation: Google MoveNet model converted by FeiGeChuanShu <https://github.com/FeiGeChuanShu/ncnn_Android_MoveNet?ref=bestofcpp.com>.
- 6. Object detection model: YOLOX converted by FeiGeChuanShu <https://github.com/FeiGeChuanShu/ncnn-android-yolox>. You can train and convert your own model with YOLOX official repository (conversion instructions included) https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX.
